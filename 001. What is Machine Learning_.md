**What is Machine Learning?**

Machine learning is a field of study that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. It involves training models to recognize patterns, make predictions, or make decisions based on input data.

In 1959, Arthur Samuel, a computer scientist who pioneered the study of artificial intelligence, described machine learning as “the study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”

A more technical definition given by Tom M. Mitchell’s (1997) : *“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”*

Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It is the study of making machines more human-like in their behavior and decisions by giving them the ability to learn and develop their own programs. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. The learning process is automated and improved based on the experiences of the machines throughout the process.

Good quality data is fed to the machines, and different algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on this data. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data at hand and the type of activity that needs to be automated.

*Types of Machine Learning:*

Supervised Learning:
In this type, models are trained on labeled data, learning to map input data to correct output labels. Examples include classification and regression problems.

Unsupervised Learning:
Here, models analyze unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groupings. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common unsupervised tasks.

Reinforcement Learning:
Reinforcement learning refers to goal-oriented algorithms, which learn how to attain a complex objective (goal) or maximize along a particular dimension over many steps. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal. For example, maximize the points won in a game over many moves.

Applications of Machine Learning:

Machine learning is used in various domains, including:

-*Healthcare* for disease prediction and diagnosis.

-*Finance* for fraud detection and stock market analysis.

-*Marketing* for customer segmentation and recommendation systems.

-*Autonomous* vehicles for object detection and navigation.

-*Natural language processing* for sentiment analysis and language translation.
