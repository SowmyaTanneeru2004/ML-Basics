***How much data is needed for machine learning?***

In this lab, we'll explore the factors that influence the amount of data required for an Machine learning project, strategies to reduce the amount of data needed, and tips to help you get started with smaller datasets.

As we mentioned in previous lab the answer to this question depends on several factors, such as the :

*type of problem being solved,

*the complexity of the Model,

*accuracy of the data,

*and availability of labeled data.

Generally speaking, the rule of thumb regarding machine learning is that you need at least ten times as many rows *(data points) as there are features (columns) in your dataset. This means that if your dataset has 10 columns (i.e., features), you should have at least 100 rows for optimal results.

Estimating the amount of data needed can be approached in two ways:

A rule-of-thumb approach :

The rule-of-thumb approach involves using heuristics, past experiences, or general guidelines to determine the dataset size. For example, a common rule of thumb might be to have a dataset that is 10 times the number of features for a specific model. However, this approach may not account for the complexity of the problem, the nature of the data, or the requirements of the model accurately.

Statistical methods :

Statistical methods are more rigorous and data-driven approaches to estimate the sample size required for a particular study or analysis. These methods take into account various factors such as desired statistical power, confidence level, effect size, and variability in the data. Common statistical methods include power analysis, t-tests, chi-squared tests, and more. Statistical methods provide a more accurate and precise estimation of the necessary dataset size based on statistical principles.

Choosing the appropriate approach depends on the specific context, the nature of the problem, the available resources, and the level of confidence and accuracy required for the analysis or model.

There are some practical experiences that will help you assess whether you need much or little observation:

--The more intuitive your hypothesis, the less data you need
--The rarer the event, the more data you need.
--The more properties your data has, the more data you need.
--The more model parameters your learning model has, the more data you need.
--Non-linear relationships need more data
--There’s still no “Golden Rule”

The Quality of a Data Set

It's ineffective to possess a large volume of data if the data is of poor quality. Quality is a significant factor to consider. However, defining what constitutes 'quality' can be ambiguous. One practical approach is to prioritize the option that yields the most favorable results empirically. From this perspective, a high-quality dataset is one that enables success in addressing the specific business problem at hand. Essentially, data is deemed good when it effectively fulfills its intended purpose.

During the data collection process, it's beneficial to establish a more precise definition of quality. Several facets of quality typically align with the development of high-performing models, including reliability, accurate feature representation, and minimizing skew.
